# audio-mods

This is my own personal journal of modifications to common recording gear. I'm writing this primarily to keep notes, but I'd be delighted if others build on my knowledge.

Please do!

If you find something wrong or can explain one of my many questions, please open an issue! It's easy, it's free and it only hurts the first time.

### Disclaimer

I don't know what I'm talking about, use at your own risk, always follow appropriate safety procedures and if you don't know what those safety procedures are, just stop and go learn more before you even _look_ at an electron again.
